## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I was motivated by this project because I was very eager to learn the fundementals of DOM's and how to creat scripted elements 
in an HTML webpage. I build this project to simply discover how a button can be used to display something on the webpage.
This challenge helped solve the issue on how to create a working button in JavaScript that allows users to generate a random password.
I learned the basic fundamentals of DOM's and how to connect JavaScript to my HTML file.
